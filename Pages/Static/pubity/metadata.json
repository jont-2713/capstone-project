    "caption": "Four friends who once dreamed of building a local getaway in Tampa Bay are now set to make millions after transforming a deserted island into a tropical paradise.🏝️💰\n\nIn 2017, the group purchased Pine Key Island, better known to locals as “Beer Can Island,” for about $65,000. Once a popular party spot, the nine-acre island had fallen into disrepair. Over the past seven years, the owners renovated the land, hosted concerts and weddings, and turned it into a community destination.\n\nNow the property, which includes 90 acres of surrounding submerged land, is on the market for over $14 million. Cole Weaver, one of the owners, admitted that while they once hoped to develop a restaurant and overcome zoning hurdles, it’s time to move on.\n\nLocals worry that a high sale price could put an end to public access, but Weaver said the group has always tried to balance private investment with keeping the island open to Tampa residents.\n\nA press release described Pine Key’s next chapter as either a private escape or a corporate retreat, positioning it as a “VIP property” for whoever takes ownership next. For the friends who bought it on a whim, it’s a staggering return on investment and the end of an ambitious chapter.\n\nSend this to some friends you’d do this with \n\n#pubity #interesting",
