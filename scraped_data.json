It shows a giant red nebula and its smaller blue neighbor, which are both part of a vast star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located 163,000 light-years away. In this picture, we can see how young, energetic, massive stars illuminate and sculpt their birthplace with powerful winds and searing ultraviolet radiation.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nAt the heart of the big red nebula are sparkling stars, each of which are 10 to 20 times more massive than our Sun. The stars' ultraviolet radiation heats the surrounding dense gas. The massive stars also unleash fierce winds of charged particles that blast away lower-density gas, forming the bubble-like structures seen on the right, which resemble coral.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nBy contrast, the seemingly isolated blue nebula at lower left was created by a solitary mammoth star 200,000 times brighter than our Sun. The blue gas was ejected by the star through a series of eruptive events during which it lost part of its outer envelope of material.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nImage description: An image is split in two. In the bottom left of the first image a bright blue ring appears, slightly fading in all directions, with a small blue dot in the middle. Red and orange waves of gas ripple, arcing from top left to top right. A light blue center appears out of the sea of red, and several bright white dots shine through. In the top right, dark blue gas emanates from the blackness of space.‚Å£\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, STScI‚Å£\n ‚Å£\n#NASA #Hubble #CoralReef #Nebula #Stars #Astronomy",

Earth‚Äôs atmosphere ‚Äì seen as layers of orange, white, and blue ‚Äì acts like a lens, bending light that passes through it and toward the astronaut‚Äôs camera. \n \nAs that light passed through Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere, it hit ice crystals that form when water vapor freezes onto tiny dust particles. These ice crystals bent, or refracted, the light, forming an arc that looks like a halo by the Moon!\n \nThrough NASA‚Äôs Artemis campaign, we‚Äôre learning more about our Moon than ever before. Next up is Artemis II, which will send a human crew to orbit the Moon for the first time in over 50 years. Follow @nasaartemis for more updates.\n \nImage description: A photograph of an arc-shaped strip of white light cradling the Moon on its lower right side.

It compresses 36 hours into a little more than a minute as it flies the virtual camera on a realistic trajectory that swings the spacecraft around the Moon's far side.\n\nNext year, the Artemis II astronauts could be the first humans to see some parts of the Moon‚Äôs far side with the naked eye, depending on the spacecraft‚Äôs final trajectory after it launches. During the nine Apollo missions that left Earth‚Äôs orbit, astronauts saw parts of the Moon‚Äôs far side, but not all of it, as they were limited by which sections were lit during their orbits.\n\nThe Artemis II crew‚Äôs observations will help pave the way for lunar science activities on future Artemis missions to the Moon‚Äôs surface, including Artemis III. Artemis III astronauts will investigate the landforms, rocks, and other features around their landing site. They will also collect rock samples for generations of analyses in Earth labs and set up several instruments to investigate lunar properties and resources ‚Äî information critical to our future human exploration efforts.\n\nCredit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio\n\n#POV #Moon #FarSideOfTheMoon #Artemis #ArtemisII #Astronauts #LunarMission #STEM #Apollo #Orion",
